# Demo: Publishing a reading-notes repo

Students are going to tell you how to create a brand-new web site with GitHub Pages, with minimal instruction.

## Demo Instructions

1. Tell students you are going to collaboratively setup a new web site.
    - Explain that you will "drive" (operate the computer),
    - but they should "navigate" (tell you what steps to take).
1. Tell them you've heard of this thing called GitHub Pages that makes it "easy".
1. ASK: If you have no idea how to do this, how would you start?
    - Take suggestions from students.
    - Hopefully, someone will suggest "google it". You can do so and open the page.
1. Show students the [GitHub Pages intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MsN8gpT6jY), which is also embedded in the GH Pages homepage.
    - ASK for reactions and observations. Expect things like "that was confusing".
    - ASK if anyone remembers the steps.
    - WRITE DOWN any steps that anyone remembers, no matter the order.
1. Hopefully, there is enough to go on to get started. Direct the flow to the steps below

### Steps to eventually follow

1. You'll need to be signed into GitHub
1. Create a new repo, named `reading-notes`
    - If you already have something there, move it, or use a burner account.
1. Include a README when making the repo
1. Publish with GH pages
   1. NOTE: Change branch from `None` to `main`
1. Check out your fancy new live site!
    - Raw content visible at: `https://USERNAME.github.io/reading-notes/README.md`
    - Rendered page at: `https://USERNAME.github.io/reading-notes/`
1. Modify the Markdown, and see the changes get deployed (after about a min)
1. Convert the content into a home page for a reading-notes
    - Briefly introduce yourself, and link to your GitHub profile
    - Explain what the site is about (it's a reading-notes)
    - Explain Growth Mindset in your own words
    - New pages will be added to the site as we learn new things
