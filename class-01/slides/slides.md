# Learn to Learn <!-- .element class="highlight" -->

<br>

“Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.”

### —Frank Herbert <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"-->

Author, Dune <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"-->

Great quote about a character from the excellent Sci-Fi book, Dune.
How much trust do you have in your ability to learn?

# How You Will Learn

Let's take a look a the different learning styles used in this course.

<div>

<div>

# Path Learning <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"-->

- Leads you along <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"-->
- Students are consumers of information <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"-->
- Predictable outcomes <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4"-->
- Creates dependency <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5"-->
- The goal: an exchange of information <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6"-->

</div>

<div>

# Sandbox Learning <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7"-->

- Fosters exploration <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8"-->
- Students are co-creators of their own learning experience <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="9"-->
- Wide range of outcomes <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="10"-->
- Creates autonomy <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="11"-->
- The goal: learning and discovery <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="12"-->

</div>

</div>

NOTE:

# TELL:

Today you'll have different learning experiences. Some portions of the class will be what we call “path” learning: we'll show you how to do something, and you can follow along and replicate what we do. Other portions of the class are what we call “sandbox” learning: we'll give you a task with a few guidelines (think of these as the sides of the sandbox), and then what you do and learn within those guidelines is up to you.

# TELL:

You may recall the experience of a sandbox environment: it can feel overwhelming and/or uncomfortable at first. That's okay! Just like there are skills for learning in a path environment, like taking notes, asking clarifying questions, and listening, there are skills for learning in a sandbox environment: defining what you want to learn and how you want to learn it, adjusting course when necessary, and being able to identify when you've learned it. Like any skills, they take time and practice to acquire. Here at Code Fellows, we intentionally use a mix of both path and sandbox learning to help you learn concepts, and also learn how to learn - an important skill for software developers.

# Skills for Sandbox Learning

- Generating and selecting ideas: what do you want to learn now? <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"-->
- Planning your learning: managing scope, finding resources. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"-->
- Experimentation: keeping track of what you've tried, what's worked, and what hasn't. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"-->
- Reflection: pausing every so often to tally what you've learned, and what new questions you have. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4"-->
- Finding help! <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5"-->

NOTE:

# TELL:

Here's just a few of the skills you'll be learning “in the sandbox.”

- Generating Ideas: sometimes you have complete freedom to decide what to learn, other times it's driven by the needs of your project or job. Programmers like to say, “what's the problem you're trying to solve?” This can be big, like “we need some way for people to know when the bus is coming,” or small, like “how do I change the background color of my site?”

- Planning - Managing Scope: this is an ongoing process of deciding: do I need to learn/do x to accomplish y? Am I setting too ambitious of a goal? Or is this so cool that I want to refocus all my attention on learning x? Managing scope is a big deal in a programmer's world: it's very easy to go down a rabbit hole and end up getting nothing done. (Hence, TDD and MVP.)

- Planning - Finding Resources: knowing what to Google, and how to understand what you find, is a skill...and it takes time to develop.

- Experimentation: knowing what you've tried, what's worked, and what hasn't.

- Reflecting: it helps to lift your head up out of the weeds/code every so often, and take stock of where you are and where you need to go.

- Finding Help: developers absolutely cannot go it alone - they ask for help from their teammates, co-workers, and other developers. We're here to help you at any stage in this process, from helping you brainstorm ideas to figuring out where to go next.

![The Learning Pit](/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-01/slides/assets/21_0.png)

NOTE:
Learning actually goes more like this.
Getting to the next level always requires the effort of engaging with the challenges you'll surely face.
Deciding to work hard is the crucial step. It all comes down to your MINDSET.

---

<!-- SLIDE 21 -->
<!-- .element class="text-only" -->

# What is Mindset?

- Mindset: self-perception or “self-theory” that people hold about themselves. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"-->
- Fixed mindset: believing basic qualities, like intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. Believing that talent alone creates success—without effort. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"-->
- Growth mindset: believing that people's most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3"-->

NOTE:
What are we talking about when we say “Mindset”?
People generally have a self perception that falls into one of two camps.

But wait! Isn't IQ fixed throughout someone's life? There's a simple test to measure IQ, afterall!
How fixed do you think your IQ is? [thumb-scale]

# Prepare Your Brain <!-- .element class="highlight" -->

<br>

“A few modern philosophers assert that an individual's intelligence is a fixed quantity, a quantity which cannot be increased. We must protest and react against this brutal pessimism… With practice, training, and above all, method, we manage to increase our attention, our memory, our judgement and literally to become more intelligent than we were before.” <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1"-->

### —ALFRED BINET <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2"-->

# Get into a Growth Mindset

| When you want to tell yourself... | Remember that... |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| I'm not good at this. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> | No one is good at it when just beginning. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->|
|  |  |
| I give up. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --> | Trying a new strategy will give you a way forward. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" --> |
|  |  |
| This is too hard. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" --> | It's meant to be hard. We grow by challenging ourselves. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" --> |
|  |  |
| I made a mistake. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" --> | That proves you've put in effort. What effort is helpful next? <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8" --> |
|  |  |
| I'll never be that smart. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="9" --> | Being smart is something you learn. You aren't done getting smarter. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="10" --> |
|  |  |
| My classmate can do it, but I can't. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="11" --> | There was a time they couldn't either. How'd they get to where they are now? <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="12" --> |
|  |  |
| It's not easy... I can't figure it out... I don't know... <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="13" --> | "...yet" <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="14" --> |

As adult learners, you get to be your own teacher.
I'm here as a facilitator, to create experiences where you can teach yourself what you want to learn.

When we struggle, It's tempting to turn to the negative self-talk of a fixed mindset. How can you get yourself back into a growth mindset.

- GitHub Pages
- Markdown

NOTE:
Take comments from the class, in a simplified code review format.

---

<!-- SLIDE 28 -->
<!-- .element class="title-and-subtitle" -->

# Why Markdown?

- HTML gives you significant control, but slows down authoring. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Web sites often exist primarily as a way to publish content. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- What if the process of writing the page was also focused on content? <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

</div>

NOTE:
Address each point as it builds in.

---

<!-- SLIDE 29 -->
<!-- .element class="title-and-subtitle" -->

# What is Markdown?

- Markdown is a lightweight markup language for generating html files. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- It is not a WYSIWYG editor like MS Word or Google Docs. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Instead it uses textual symbols to indicate the structure of the page. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- For example: <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

`# This is a heading` <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">This is a heading</h1> <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->

---

<!-- SLIDE 30 -->
<!-- .element class="title-and-subtitle" -->

# How do we Markdown?

- GitHub uses Markdown pretty much everywhere: <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  - Top level README.md files are auto-rendered <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  - Any other .md files <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
  - Issues, comments, code reviews, etc… <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- Exact syntax is covered by many great guides (links in the assignment). <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
- Go experiment with it, and see what you can learn! <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->
