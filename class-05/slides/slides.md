What did you learn?

NOTE:
There are 4 skills in language learning: Hearing, speaking, reading, writing (and we generally develop them in that order).

These review sessions are your chance to SPEAK with this new language. Practice using the right words. Let these foreign sounds emanate from YOUR mouth. The names of these esoteric characters matter, and using the wrong one will make a difference to the computer.

Go around the room. Each student can share a thing learned, or a sentence from their Learning Journal. Help them use the right words. Document the vocab as necessary on the whiteboard.

Ask specifically for what was learned by reading about other student's learning.
