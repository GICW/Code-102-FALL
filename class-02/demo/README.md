# Demo: Code Editors and Command Line

## Code Editor Demo

Show a code editor in action, by writing some example HTML in VS Code. Have students identify what it does to help you.

They will hopefully notice things like:

- Syntax highlighting
- Indentation
- Autocompletion
- File tree
- Auto-closing tags
- Multi-line edits

## Terminal Demo

Explain:

- The terminal is an Alternate Universe view into what's going on in the computer.
- Before we had the computing power for fancy graphics / windows, all interaction was via text.
- Text commands in, text results out.

Position a terminal window and a File Explorer window side by side. Navigate through some project directories and take the same action in the Explorer for every step.

Commands to SHOW (without in-depth explanation for now):

- cd
- ls
- mkdir
- touch
- echo >> filename.txt
- if time allows: grep for contents of a file within a dir
