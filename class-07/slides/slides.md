What did you learn?

NOTE:
There are 4 skills in language learning: Hearing, speaking, reading, writing (and we generally develop them in that order).

These review sessions are your chance to SPEAK with this new language. Practice using the right words. Let these foreign sounds emanate from YOUR mouth. The names of these esoteric characters matter, and using the wrong one will make a difference to the computer.

Go around the room. Each student can share a thing learned, or a sentence from their Learning Journal. Help them use the right words. Document the vocab as necessary on the whiteboard.

Ask specifically for what was learned by reading about other student's learning.

Steps to success

NOTE:
2 analogies to help us think about what programming is:

- Ask the class: How is programming like a recipe (say, for baking a cake)?
  - Help them make the connections
  - You have ingredients (input),
  - steps to follow (processing),
  - and a result (output).
  - If you aren't careful in how you follow along, you'll end up with something that is not the result you hoped for!
- Another way to think about it… Programming is about speaking the language of the computer.
  - Computers are VERY good at doing what you tell them to do. In fact, that's all they can do.
  - Every time you write a program, you are teaching the machine how to do a new trick.
  - Think of it as training the robot to do something new.
  - You are the teacher, and must give clear and precise instructions.
  - Let's practice that with an in-class exercise

# Teach the robot... <!-- .element class="highlight" -->

- How to complete a task <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  - Pair up. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  - Silently, each partner writes out instructions. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
  - Test it out. Take turns playing the robot: <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
    - Give your sequence of commands to the robot. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
    - The robot does only what they're told. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->
    - Switch roles. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" -->
  - Combine what you learn to make a single set of instructions. <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8" -->

NOTE:
Advance the bullets as you read each instruction to the class.

Make it clear that the robot speaks english, and is very obedient. It does only what it's told.
Students should write instructions with pencil on paper, and iterate to combine best of both.
When they have their final instructions, have them try it on you, the instructor. Be as literal as possible when following instructions, and look for ways to make it break.
Ask for observations, guide towards:

- It's hard to get it right
- Not all instructions are on the same “level”
- It takes iteration to get better

Behold the power of step by step actions...

NOTE:
Set students going on the DISCUSSION assignment, to explore this further.

JavaScript: Putting the fun in functions since 1995

NOTE:
See if you can get a good WHY, WHAT, HOW from the students.

# `<refactoring>` <!-- .element class="highlight" -->

Same results, better code.

NOTE:
Ask if anyone has already had an experience of changing the code they wrote, without changing the result of the code. Explore how and why
DEMO: Convert the demo code by encapsulating logic in functions. Use just a single JS src file, and call functions from <script> tags.
