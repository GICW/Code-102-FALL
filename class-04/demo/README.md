# Demo: Structure with Semantic HTML

## Demo Instructions

Check out the lab instructions: Students will be building their own site, with a partner.

For the demo, follow the steps of the lab, with the class driving, in a distinct problem domain. Quickly select something like "rainbow recycling" or "pet snuggling service" or "Best Happy Hour Spots".

Students will tell you what they read about understanding their audience (personas), wireframing, and structuring the page. Select 1 persona to create for. Wireframe an "every page" site, with boxes to represent the usual layout of a page.

Then header, h1, nav, ul, li, a, main, h2s, footer. Optionally: aside, section, article.
