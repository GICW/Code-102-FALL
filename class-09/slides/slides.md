What did you learn?

NOTE:
There are 4 skills in language learning: Hearing, speaking, reading, writing (and we generally develop them in that order).

These review sessions are your chance to SPEAK with this new language. Practice using the right words. Let these foreign sounds emanate from YOUR mouth. The names of these esoteric characters matter, and using the wrong one will make a difference to the computer.

Go around the room. Each student can share a thing learned, or a sentence from their Learning Journal. Help them use the right words. Document the vocab as necessary on the whiteboard.

Ask specifically for what was learned by reading about other student's learning.

# Career Coaching <!-- .element class="highlight" -->

- LinkedIn Setup <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
  - Professional picture <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  - Software Developer <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Resume Prep <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
  - Basic setup <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

NOTE:
Open the links from the lab assignment, and briefly discuss each one. Take questions from students, so they are prepared to work through the “individual workshops” on their own.

Career Coaching is important. Remind students that resumé and LinkedIn are always works in progress that require fine tuning. Students will make constant adjustments from 102 - 401. Encourage a fairly high level pass for this 102 assignment. Students should get a solid base resume and must use template to be part of the Career Accelerator Program when they graduate from Code 401.

LinkedIn connections should be made with classmates.
