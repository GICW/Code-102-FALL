# Demo: JavaScript in Action

## Demo Instructions

Review the lab. Students will be adding javascript to their own pages.

Start with the html / css site you built in the last class.

As you go add JS code, show off live JS in the console.

Concepts you should introduce to become familiar with JS:

1. What is a variable, and how to declare it
1. What is `console.log` and how to use it
1. What is `prompt('message')` and how to capture user input
1. What is an `if` statement
1. What is an `if...else` statement and how it can be used with `prompt()`
1. What is `document.write`

JS Examples to add to your code base:

1. input
    - Use `prompt` to grab some input from the user (Perhaps the current Hour?)

1. processing (in this case, conditional generation of dynamic content)
    - Using the Hour input, show an `if else` block.

1. output
    - Show students `document.write`
    - Show alternative method of output: `console.log()`

Ask students how they'd like to integrate dynamic content in their site. Some ideas:

- Prompt for user's name, and show it in a greeting.
- Prompt for age or birthday, and show selective content based on age
- Prompt for the user's city or state, and, for certain values, give specific info (Ranking? Weather guess?).
