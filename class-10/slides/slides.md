What did you learn?

NOTE:
There are 4 skills in language learning: Hearing, speaking, reading, writing (and we generally develop them in that order).

These review sessions are your chance to SPEAK with this new language. Practice using the right words. Let these foreign sounds emanate from YOUR mouth. The names of these esoteric characters matter, and using the wrong one will make a difference to the computer.

Go around the room. Each student can share a thing learned, or a sentence from their Learning Journal. Help them use the right words. Document the vocab as necessary on the whiteboard.

Ask specifically for what was learned by reading about other student's learning.

# Tell: What do you want to cover from all that you learned this week?

Prompt the students with "looking back over the course, what open questions do you have about any of the topics that we have covered?"  To prepare students for the final exam and round out their 102 experience:

- Create empty html, css, js files and based off of student questions work through their questions
